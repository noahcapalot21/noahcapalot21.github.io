            <h1>My Favorite BikeShop</h1>
            <p>There's something different about the bike shop on 2nd street and Ave A, which tells you that there's always someone there, never empty. Across the street there is a big piece of art that says lower east side. There is no grand entrance. No sign. Just a bike shop. When walking in front of the shop you can see all the people inside. Some are sitting having a good time enjoying the atmosphere that is there. People working on bikes. Will the shop owner has his car out in the front by all the tied up bikes. You are walking past the ninety nine cent pizza shop and the deli on the corner of the street. Right next to the deli is the bike shop. Standing there, you are standing at the most divested bike shop in the city. People from many different cultural backgrounds are at this one place. To ride and just have fun. The first time I went there I felt a little off because the people were so different from the people I hung out with. They were more so rough. They taught me to not cry or get scared of falling and to get up and keep going. Soon I realised that they have grown to be more like a family to me. All these people come here to have fun and feel at peace because we all come together and ride. Teach. Conversate. Give advice. We all have respect for each other as people and in the community</p>
           <p>People come to the bike shop to get their bikes fixed and when someone with a bmx bike comes there that instant click. They see our bikes and we see there's, We soon see them again and again coming back to get their bikes fixed. They will soon become a part of our community riding bikes and having fun. The bike shop taught us that NYC is really bigger than we have ever imagined. I knew that NYC was big but when I went to the bike shop and started riding with all these people it really opened my eyes. I got to see all these new places. When we ride we are always exploring NYC and everything in it. When we ride bikes it always seemed to be warm even on some chilly days. Pedaling throwing yourself back the feeling of almost falling back but never will sitting in your sweet spot pressing the brakes. This, this is the feeling of freedom not having to do anything but ride. The people that are good at tricks are at the front of the group and the beginners are at the back. We would always take the same route going to 14th street then to 42nd always seeing the same starbucks the same building the same signs. 42nd st would always be fun because there's a lot of people dancing sitting down watching all the billboards change color. We never lack respect for each other because we earned the respect of others from landing our tricks and showing how hard we work. We would practice our tricks at the world trade center. People would watch and applaud us for doing tricks.</p>
            <p>When we ride we ride as one we would never lack respect for each other because we earned the respect of others from landing our tricks and showing how hard we work. The newly paved and tiled section of the street with lights protruding from everywhere I practiced with everyone else. The intense focus we all had studying our mistakes trying to land our tricks. Going down a hill as fast as we could, lifting the bike up to one wheel balancing on the pegs. The wind blowing pushing us back focusing on our past mistakes so we don't make them again. For some it took us weeks to land one trick. We would look out for each other and we would go places in nyc that we weren't even planning to be. Exploring the city of New york. Buying each other food because we couldn't afford a snack or a beverage. Waiting for each other to wake up in the morning so we can ride. The excitement I would feel in the mornings would start my day. There would be a post on instagram and it would say “We ride as one.” seeing that for the first time made me think about the community at the bike shop. I would wonder if the people at the bike shop would think about the community as the way that I do the love and the passion I have for the community and riding bikes.</p>
